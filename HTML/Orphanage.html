            In the heart of every child is a hunger for home. Not just for food and a place to sleep, but for safety and
            community. <br><br>We are a family, where love guides us all as we grow and expand year after year. Not just
            a
            regular children's home, we
            are a nearly self-sustaining organization; a working farm, a vibrant school, receiving no government
            assistance of any
            kind. <br><br>Take a look around and if you have any questions just get in contact with us via the menu
            above.
